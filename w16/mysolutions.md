Examine your water consumption solution:
this is how i would handle it:
- create the function that utilizing washing the dish washer / washing machine
option 1:
- have 2 different functions, 1 has dish washer then 1 has washing machine
option 2:
- have 1 function, have a drop down menu that says, do you have both a dish washer and washing machine?  if yes, multiply waterConsumptionPoints by 2, if no, multiply waterConsumptionPoints by 1
i like option 2 the most, i think this way would be easier on paper but we shall see if i have troubles coding it.
