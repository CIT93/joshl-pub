Objectives for this weeks discussion board:
1. DONE copy end code to w9 
2. DONE remove required attributes from first and last inptus in the html 
3. 2 options:
    - update the form submission to only calculate footprint and render the 
      table if the first and last name as provided.

What ive done so far:
I got first name required to pop up IF you dont put an entry in the first name submission spot
It also works properly, it just doesnt go away if you mess up initially but fix it on the 2nd attempt.
fixed it, had to make an else statement that displayed empty text to overwrite previous text box
got both first and last name messages to pop up

NEXT GOAL:
only submit carboot footprint and render if the first and last name are here
done

note: i had an issue with 1 letter digits and realized i type it wrong. had to repush my code
